    <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
  <p> HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
    HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts 
    of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
    The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words
    , can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
     </p>
<h3>Anatomy of HTML Element</h3>
<p> <b> opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), 
    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts totake
    effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
    <b> The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash 
    before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
     Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
    <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
    <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
